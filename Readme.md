Recvoery Cat (RC) Charts ðŸ“Š

This repo contains some drafts of Chart.js code for creating some bar charts for the purpose of implementing it with our recovery cat app (code base see: https://gitlab.com/recoverycat/rcc-client). 

For running this code you need to clone this repo and run `yarn install` and then `yarn dev`.
